# Day 1 : Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU compiler toolchain

Day 1 of the workshop included the following:
     
     1. Introduction to RISC-V basic keywords
     2. Labwork for RISC-V software toolchain
     3. Integer number representation
     4. Signed and unsigned arithmetic operations
     
    
**List of commands**
## For compileing using GNU toolchain

1. Open a file named sum_1_to_n. using leafpad editor.  
     `$leafpad sum_1_to_n.c`   
2. Write your C code for sum of numbers from 1 to  n (say n =9).
3. Compile using GNU compiler.   
    ` $gcc sum_1_to_n.c`   
4. Run the compiled object file (Default object file formed with the name a.out).
     `$./a/out`
